# Facebook Graph Tools
## Copyright 2018 | MBWhitestone

This repository contains some basic PHP-tools with the aim of getting different
kinds of data using the Facebook API. These scripts are only a first 
approximation of the possibilities and optimization is still needed.

# Tools
- **album.php** a simple phpscript displaying the fotoalbum of a specific 
Facebook page. One should add an *access_token* and *object_id*
- **group_posts.php** a simple phpscript displaying the main timeline of a 
Facebook group page.
